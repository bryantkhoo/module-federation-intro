## Setting up the demo container

Basic Repo structure:

- **lerna**: Tool to simply monorepo implementation on codesandbox.io
- **container directory**: contains source code for our container application
  - webpack file: contains very basic setup with just babel loader for React and HtmlWebpackPlugin (simplifies creation of index.html to serve your bundle)

## Child App + Module Federation Plugin

In the sandbox below, we have an additional `/child` repository for the child app. In reality this dir could be its own repository. Its almost similar to how our original container app was structured, with the exception of specifying the module federation plugin.

The sandbox below shows how you can setup the module federation plugin such that Child app exposes App.jsx for the Container to consume.

For the container app, we refactor entry point in container app to include bootstrap.js

- Gives webpack the opportunity for webpack to fetch new runtime dependency from childapp

#### Module federation configs:

- **name**: name of current app, used by consumer if app exposes remote
- **filename**: name of file that exposes list of remotes and how to load them
- [**remotes**](https://webpack.js.org/guides/public-path/): (e.g `child: child@//localhost:6359`) LHS: module used when importing in consumer app, RHS: name field in child's webpack file and url to get remote from
- **shared**: will be explained in next section

#### During the bundling process, the following files are created for the container app:

1. **main.js**: Entry point, contains content of index.js
2. **bootstrap.js**: Contains dependencies of container app (such as child app's remote). Allows webpack to know it has to fetch remote before running this file.

#### Sequence of events on the browser when you start up the app:

1. main.js from container is loaded and executed
2. bootstrap.js is loaded from container, theres a dependency there from child
3. remoteEntry.js is loaded from child app, dependencies from remoteEntry of child app are loaded next (App.js)
