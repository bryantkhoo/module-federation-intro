Micro-frontends are exactly what you think they are!

Its an architecture that composes multiple semi-independent or fully independent micro applications into a single web application.

This is similar to the micro-services backend architecture.

## The movement towards micro services

<div style={{ position: 'relative', height: '200px', margin: '32px' }}>
  <Image
    src="/assets/monolithic-to-micro-services.png"
    alt="monolithic-to-micro-services.png"
    layout={'fill'}
    objectFit={'contain'}
  />
</div>

As your project/application grows you might be motivated to split your code base into verticals.

With micro services you get the following benefits:

- Split your application into vertical pillars - you get to organise your teams vertically too
- Isolation between applications
- Framework/Technology agnostic

## What if we did the same on the frontend? - Micro frontends

<div style={{ position: 'relative', height: '300px', margin: '32px' }}>
  <Image
    src="/assets/micro-frontend-1.png"
    alt="monolithic-to-micro-services.png"
    layout={'fill'}
    objectFit={'contain'}
  />
</div>

You get the same verticals on the frontend, with an aggregation/container layer.

The aggregation layer decides how to render each of your frontend services on the DOM.

## Types of integrations

#### Build-time integration

- Container app has access to child app's code **before** it gets loaded in the browser
- This happens when the source code compiles
- Possible implementation: Publishing your child app on NPM Registry
- Pro: Easy to setup
- Con: Container has to be rebuilt and deployed everytime child changes

#### Run-time integration

- Container app gets access to child app's code **after** it gets loaded in the browser
- Requests to child app's code are made on the browser
- Pro 1: Independent build + deploy pipelines
- Pro 2: you can always deploy different versions of child
- Con: setup is abit more complicated

#### Server-side integration

- When a request for Container app's resource reaches the server, **decide on the server side** if child app should be loaded together
- Requests to child app's code are made on server side

For the rest of the sharing, we will be looking at Module Federation, which is one of the more performant solutions for **Run-time** integration right now.
