## Webpack

The most popular bundler for frontend applications. There are other up and coming bundlers like vite that we should look out for, but for now webpack seems to be go-to bundler for most applications.

<div style={{ position: 'relative', height: '400px', margin: '32px' }}>
  <Image
    src="/assets/1636486663-module-bundler-comparison-graph.png"
    alt="1636486663-module-bundler-comparison-graph.png"
    layout={'fill'}
    objectFit={'contain'}
  />
</div>

Webpack's main job as a bundler is like most bundlers

1. Create a dependency graph from a specified entry point (usually index.js) by traversing through its dependencies.
2. Pack/Bundle your applications assets such that they can be processed by the browser. The dependency graph in step 1 is used to integrate multiple code files.

<div style={{ position: 'relative', height: '300px', margin: '32px' }}>

    alt="Webpack-chunking-and-bundling-diagram.pngg"
    layout={'fill'}
    objectFit={'contain'}
  />
</div>

## [Module Federation](https://webpack.js.org/concepts/module-federation/)

Module federation is a plugin introduced with webpack 5, with the main purpose of allowing builds that are fully independent to be composed to form a single application.

Some terminologies:

- Shell/Container application: main application that will consume other remote modules. The main entry point for your application.
- Child application: exposes remotes to other applications to consume in runtime

[Use cases](https://webpack.js.org/guides/public-path/):

- Composing a single SPA from multiple builds.
  - You could also share common components in runtime, as opposed to build time
  - Container app can defined shared modules to avoid code duplication
- Building component libraries for consumption in run-time
