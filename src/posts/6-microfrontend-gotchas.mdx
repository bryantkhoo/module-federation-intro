## Some things to take note of:

- **CSS conflicts** are possible across apps. Possible solutions
  - Scoping your css class with prefixes
  - CSS in js solutions, such as CSS Modules, Styled Components etc
- **Interapp communication**, it might be tempting to tightly couple your apps
  - dont share your UI states if possible
- **Types** are lost in remotes. modole federation shares js in runtime, types that you need in on your local (compile time) dont exist in your consumed remote
