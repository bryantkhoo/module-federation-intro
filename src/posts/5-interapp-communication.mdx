With module federation, each of your apps run on the same javascript environment. You can share state across apps in ways similar to how you would do it in a monolithic app.

Some examples include:

1. **Custom event handlers** - set up your own event listeners with a publisher subscribe pattern
2. **Use a open source state management library** - Libraries like [**Zustand**](https://github.com/pmndrs/zustand) help manage your app's global state
3. **React Context** - For react apps you can also use the [**React Context**](https://reactjs.org/docs/context.html) API to do this

## React Context example

In the following code example, the container app expose's its Context as a remote.

<div className="iframe-container">
  <iframe

    className="iframe-codesandbox"
    title="mfe-intro-basic-setup"
    allow="accelerometer; ambient-light-sensor; camera; encrypted-media; geolocation; gyroscope; hid; microphone; midi; payment; usb; vr; xr-spatial-tracking"
    sandbox="allow-forms allow-modals allow-popups allow-presentation allow-same-origin allow-scripts"
  />

</div>

## Routing

React router 6 example with nested Routes

<div className="iframe-container">
  <iframe
    src="https://codesandbox.io/embed/mfe-intro-mod-fed-nested-routing-mod-fed-intro-k44prm?autoresize=1&expanddevtools=1&fontsize=14&module=%2Fcontainer%2FApp.jsx&theme=dark"
    className="iframe-codesandbox"
    title="mfe-intro-basic-setup"
    allow="accelerometer; ambient-light-sensor; camera; encrypted-media; geolocation; gyroscope; hid; microphone; midi; payment; usb; vr; xr-spatial-tracking"
    sandbox="allow-forms allow-modals allow-popups allow-presentation allow-same-origin allow-scripts"
  />
  >
</div>

#### Some gotchas regarding routing:

You might already what the following API does:

- **History**: An object that you can use to get and set current path
- **Router**: Allows you to render different content based on path
  The following APIs are also commonly provided by routing libraries like React router, their implementation might vary depending on the library
- [**Browser Router**](https://reactrouter.com/docs/en/v6/routers/browser-router): looks at path portion of url and lets you know what path user is on
- [**Memory Router**](https://reactrouter.com/docs/en/v6/routers/memory-router): keep track of path in memory (does not use url in browser address bar)

<br />
If you are either using <ins>more than 1 copies of Browser Router</ins>, there
could be a very small chance for <ins>race conditions</ins> to occur because 2
copies of the same object might be trying to change the current path.

Also, if your application requires a cross framework setup like a React Container with Angular/Vue Child app, you might end up with more than one kind of implementation of the browser router object.

<br />
One solution to the above problem is to use a **Browser history instance in the container
app, and child apps use Memory Router.** However this means that you probably will
need to synchronise the paths in all Router implementations:

- Child App needs to communicate to Container when route changes due to logic in child app, so that <ins>correct url shows on browser</ins>.
- Container App needs to communicate to Child app when route changes due to logic in Container app, so that <ins>child app's router can react to the change</ins>.
