With module federation, each of your apps run on the same javascript environment. You can share state across apps in ways similar to how you would do it in a monolithic app.

Some examples include:

1. Custom event handlers - set up your own event listeners with a publisher subscribe pattern
2. Use a open source state management library - Libraries like Zustand help manage your app's global state
3. React Context - For react apps you can also use the React Context API to do this

## React Context example

- Container app should expose the context as a remote

## Routing

React router 6 example with nested Routes

Using an event handler to manage routing on a single history object
